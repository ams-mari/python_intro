The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very 
{adjective} {animal} {first_verb} down the hallway. ""{exclamation.capitalize()}!"" I yelled. But all 
I could think to do was to {second_verb} over and over. Miraculously, 
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {third_verb}
right in front of my family.
My daughter {adverb} {fourth_verb}, my wife wanted a {noun}, but I was in shock. Once the {animal} left, 
we {fifth_verb} back home. As soon as we arrive, my daughter {sixth_verb} to her sister: 
"WE SAW A {adjective.upper()} {animal.upper()} {first_verb.upper()}!!" 
That was a {second_adjective} day! But now it's a {third_adjective} story that we tell our friends and family. """)
